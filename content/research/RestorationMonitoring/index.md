We are part of a [large-scale multi-institutional coral reef restoration project](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/new-hope-puerto-ricos-coral-reefs) led by the non-profit [Institute for Socio-Ecological Research](https://www.isercaribe.org/) funded by the [National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Habitat Conservation](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/office-habitat-conservation). We are monitoring the restored coral reef benthic communities and comparing them to nearby reference sites to quantify the effects of coral reef restoration on overall coral cover and whether this restoration has the capacity to reverse long-term declines in coral reef reef growth as part of PhD student [Townsend's](https://theberglab.com/team/josephtownsend/) dissertation.
