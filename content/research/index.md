How do environmental conditions and disturbances drive physiology, biogeochemical processes, and ecosystem functions of marine environments? In addition to this general line of research, we seek to address related questions as part of developing partnerships with local governmental agencies, non-profits, and community groups. Please contact Dr. Courtney (travis.courtney@upr.edu) if you would like to discuss any potential collaborations.

Our team uses a combination of in situ oceanographic sensors, coral growth records, biogeochemical measurements, benthic surveys, computer models, satellite data, and skeletal chemistry as part of our research efforts.

#### Current Projects

</div>

##### Puerto Rico Coral Reef Water Quality and Biological Condition Gradient Project

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 

We are currently working on a project to monitor 42 coral reef sites around Puerto Rico for biogeochemistry, benthic communities, and fish communities to assess the potential drivers of coral reef condition as part of a project funded by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. Please visit the [Caribbean Coral Reef Institute webpage](https://www.uprm.edu/ccri/research/water-quality-project/) for further details on our Puerto Rico Coral Reef Water Quality Monitoring Project.

</div>

##### EcoEléctrica Compliance Monitoring Project

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 

We are maintaining water quality regulatory compliance monitoring for the EcoEléctrica power plant in Bahía de Guayanilla, PR to assess the potential influence of seawater intake and outfalls on the surrounding ecosystems of the bay.

</div>

##### Other Projects

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 

Our team is also conducting research on a range of individual projects relating to themes of coastal biogeochemistry and ecology in Puerto Rico. Please see the [Team page](team.html) for additional information on these projects.

#### Computational Tools

</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 

We developed a [tool to estimate coral reef carbonate production](https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/blog/coralnet-now-estimates-carbonate-production-rates/) to the automated coral reef image analysis software [CoralNet](https://coralnet.ucsd.edu/) and an [Excel tool](https://zenodo.org/record/7051628) to estimate net coral reef calcification from seawater chemistry data.

#### Open Data Science

</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;"> 

Our lab is committed to open data science and typically use the open source software R for our all code and analyses. All research outputs lead by PI Travis Courtney, including the source code for this website, are all freely accessible on [Github](https://github.com/traviscourtney) and individual research outputs from our team members will also be made publicly available by their respective [Github](https://github.com/) pages and public data repositories.
