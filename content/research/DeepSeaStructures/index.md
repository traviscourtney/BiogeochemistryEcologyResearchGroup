We collected imagery aboard the [Nautilus Live Cruise NA156 Ocean Exploration through Advanced Imaging ](https://nautiluslive.org/cruise/na156) using next-generation cameras aboard the ROV Hercules and are are developing 3D digital elevation models using structure from motion technology to explore the structural complexity of deep sea coral beds in Hawai'i as part of [Rueda's](https://theberglab.com/team/ignaciorueda/) thesis.
