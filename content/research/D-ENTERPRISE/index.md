The broader D-ENTERPRISE initiative aims to increase diversity and inclusion in the ocean sciences through establishing a collaborative network of regional hubs between leading research universities and minority serving institutions complete with direct support and mentoring of students and faculty. Within this D-ENTERPRISE network, the Inclusion and Belonging in Ocean Science (IBOS) Collaborative between the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez, University of Massachusetts Boston, and University of Rhode Island. The IBOS Collaborative aims to support annual cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students from underrepresented backgrounds in the ocean sciences with assistantships, mentored research opportunities, monthly professional development, and an annual trip to explore opportunities in the ocean sciences between our institutions.
