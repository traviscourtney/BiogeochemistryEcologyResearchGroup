title: About
description: "We are an interdisciplinary team of biogeochemists, ecosystem ecologists, and oceanographers in the [Department of Marine Sciences](https://www.uprm.edu/cima/) at the [University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez](https://www.uprm.edu/) researching how climate change and human impacts alter the functioning of marine ecosystems. We prioritize studies focused here on the coastal ecosystems of Puerto Rico and to address questions of interest to local governmental agencies, non-profits, and community groups. 

Please contact Professor Travis (travis.courtney@upr.edu) to discuss any potential collaborations or to join our lab.
