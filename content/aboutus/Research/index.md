We are an interdisciplinary team of biogeochemists, ecosystem ecologists, and oceanographers in the [Department of Marine Sciences](https://www.uprm.edu/cima/) at the [University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez](https://www.uprm.edu/) researching how climate change and human impacts alter the functioning of marine ecosystems. 

Much of our research has focused on the quantifying the rates and drivers of the ecological function of coral reef building. We aim to better understand how climate change and human impacts are affecting the maintenance of coral reef structures and the ecosystem services those structures provide.

In addition to coral reef growth, we prioritize studies focused here on the coastal ecosystems of Puerto Rico and to address questions of interest to local governmental agencies, non-profits, and community groups. 

We collaborate with [ISER Caribe](https://www.isercaribe.org/) on [Ulva seaweed aquaculture](https://theberglab.com/projects/ulvaaquaculture/), [optimizing Diadema sea urchin restoration for coral reef growth](https://theberglab.com/team/iraisluquis/), and [monitoring the effects of coral reef restoration](https://theberglab.com/projects/restorationmonitoring/). 

We also work with the [Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources](https://www.drna.pr.gov/) to collect [water quality data for the coral reefs of Puerto Rico](https://theberglab.com/projects/waterqualitymonitoring/). 

Our students have also worked on a range of local projects in Puerto Rico including [water quality compliance monitoring for the EcoElectrica powerplant](https://theberglab.com/team/lab-alumni/), [quantifying seagrass carbon cycling and productivity](https://theberglab.com/projects/previous-projects/), and [assessing the impacts of Sargassum accumulation events on coastal hypoxia](https://theberglab.com/team/lab-alumni/).

Please visit our [Team](https://theberglab.com/team/) and [Projects](https://theberglab.com/projects/) to pages to learn more about our current efforts and view our [Publications on Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=hK_DxtUAAAAJ) for a full list of our previous studies.
