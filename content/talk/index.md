### Dr. Travis Courtney
####  (he/him/his)
#### Principal Investigator
#### travis.courtney@upr.edu

Dr. Courtney earned his B.S. in Geology and Environmental Science from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where his research focused on the effects of temperature and ocean acidification on the growth rates and calcite stable isotopic composition of a tropical sea urchin. He then worked at Northeastern University to construct century-scale records of coral growth rates and skeletal geochemistry from Belize. Courtney completed his PhD and postdoc in Oceanography in the SCOOBY lab at Scripps Institution of Oceanography investigating the rates and drivers of coral reef calcification and developed user-friendly tools to assess net coral reef calcification from benthic imagery and seawater chemistry data. He is now an assistant professor in the Department of Marine Sciences at the University of Puerto Rico Mayagüez and an affiliated researcher of the [Caribbean Coral Reef Institute](https://www.uprm.edu/ccri/).
