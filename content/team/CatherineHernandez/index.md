Hernández Rodriguez quantified seagrass metabolism to better understand blue carbon uptake and seagrass bed biogeochemistry through a multidisciplinary approach to better understand the role of seagrass meadows for carbon sequestration and seawater buffering under ocean acidification for her MS thesis and is currently volunteering in the lab to assist with our water quality projects and coral reef image segmentation. She is currently quantifying the benthic cover of coral reef organisms from large area imagery.
