description: Our group is located on Isla Magueyes, La Parguera as part of the [Department of Marine Sciences](https://www.uprm.edu/cima/) at the [University of Puerto Rico Mayag√ºez](https://www.uprm.edu/). We seek to understand how the biogeochemistry of nearshore waters and the maintenance of coral reef structures are affected by local impacts and global environmental change with an emphasis on the coastal ecosystems of Puerto Rico.
